# File Spawner

**File Spawner** is a friction-free utility for Obsidian that allows you to spawn any file type and automatically embed it into your current note.

## Purpose

**Ideal for:** Seamlessly co-locating analysis code (`.js`, `.py`) and data (`.json`) with your research. Instantly spawn and link executable scripts without breaking your writing flow or switching windows.

## Features

- **Spawn Any File Type**: Quickly create files with extensions like `.pdf`, `.zip`, `.txt`, `.docx`, etc.
- **Auto-Embedding**: Automatically inserts a wiki link (e.g., `![[filename.ext]]`) at your current cursor position.
- **Context-Aware**: Spawns the new file in the same folder as the currently active note.
- **Simple Workflow**: Triggered via a single command and a clean modal interface.

## How to Use

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`).
2. Search for `File Spawner: Spawn new file and embed`.
3. In the modal:
   - Enter the **File Name**.
   - Enter the **File Extension** (e.g., `pdf`, `txt`).
4. Click **Spawn**.
5. The file is created in your vault, and a link is inserted into your current note.
